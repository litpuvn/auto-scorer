1,,6,"yes they all go into the ground, but aventually they all turn into water vapor. (it could take a long time though)",ground water vapor,,
,,6,"The ground can only absorb so much water. Once it takes all it can, the rain will stay on the surface where it lands and eventually evaporates.. The water absorbed goes to plants, which is also cycled back into the cycle.",absorb water rain surface lands evaporates plants cycle,,
,,6,"The water can be absorbed into the ground, but it can also be released back into the atmosphere, as shown by the green dots by transpiration. Transpiration occurs from plants and trees realeasing the water back into the atmosphere.",water obsorbed released atmosphere transpiration plants trees releasing,,
,,6,We do not believe that water gets trapped into the ground because the ground absorbs the most amount of heat from the sun and the water is going to start to rise and evaporate. The ground begins to keep absorbing the water rather than trapping it. The water begins to move under ground due to the weight of the water that is being put on the ground. The black part of the diagram shows that the weight of the water is not able to go through it like it does on the other levels of ground in the diagram.,absorb heat sun water rise evaporate move weight,,
,,6,"When water is absorbed by the ground, it is trapped and will not escape.This happens because the sun rays won't reach the underground water due to the different layers above causing the water to stay trapped, not evaporating. Based on the model when it precipitates the water is piling up under ground until it can't sink any further into the ground because the different layers absorbs the water as it sinks. And the only water that somewhat evaporates is the water that is at the very top because the sun rays can get to it.",water absorbed not escape sun rays underground trapped layers precipitates evaporates,,
,,6,Because water is still coming up through the sediment slowly and not in such high quantities as the water that is exposed to the air. This is seen through he few light blue water droplets that are evaporating over the sediment in the diagram.,water sediment slowly high quantities exposed air droplets evaporating,,
,,6,"Yes, the water is trapped because there is no sunlight reaching the water therefore the water would not be able to evaporate and leave the sediment. As shown on the model only the water at the top receiving sunlight is the one permitted to leave. Also the water will continue to be absorbed by the layers as it does not stop ascending.",water trapped sunlight evaporate leaving sediment permitted leave absorbed ascending,,
,,6,"The water when absorbed by the ground, is not trapped in the ground because the water evaporates. When the water is precipitating it falls into the river. The water in the model is moving slowly but a lot at a period of time. Then the water gets absorbed by the ground, the water is not trapped because it is moving very slowly and the water can evaporate.",water absorbed ground trapped evaporates precipitating falls river long time,,
,,6,Because the video showed the water staying in the ground. the gaps in between the rocks makes it possible for the water to flow through most of the rock,water staying gaps rocks flow through,,
,,6,"The water looks trapped because it can not continue to flow below the black layer of land is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.",water trapped flow below black layer land beneath earth surface soil pore spaces formation onconsolidated deposit aquifer depth saturated groundwater springs seeps oases wetlands hydrogeology hydrology,,
,,6,"Once the sun comes out, it can be evaporated back into the clouds. When it gets cloudy the clouds are filled with rain which is the rain originally from the ground and then that falls and gets reabsorbs in the ground. The water is able to move because of the amount of water that is in the ground and how what sediments are on top of each other. The water collects and goes in between the cracks of each sediment and create a pool of water under the rocks. In the model the rain is falling down from the sky from the clouds and fall on the sediments and go into the ground they then go to the lowest point of the ground to gather up into a body of water",sun evaporated clouds filled rain ground falls reabsorbs sediments pool water under rocks,,
