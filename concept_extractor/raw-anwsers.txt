Some of the water will evaporate.
When water is absorbed in the ground, it does not stay in the ground forever. The water can turn into evaportation and come up from the ground.

Because that is what the model shows
in some cases this is true but not all the time. the water cycle includes evaporation. So  therefore, water that is absorbed into the ground is not always trapped in the ground

As water moves through the water cycle, it is absorbed into the ground and then evaporated, and then it falls from the sky and the cylcle continues.
Water in the ground can be removed as a fresh water source. it can also be evaporated back into the atmosphere.
Once the water percolates into the ground it cannot go back up through the ground.
most of the water that went into the ground it the diagram never evaporated
it can be pulled out in a well, stream along, or be evaporated
the water gets trapped in the porosity space of the particles
The water is eventually evaporated and goes through the cycle again.
run offs and other features like that extrude water from under ground to above the surface
we saw the blue dots not get trapped and they evaporated
because the water cannot evaporate into the sky while its under the ground. 
if it is absorbed into the ground it can not come back up because of  gravity
Unless animals and plants remove it then it will stay trapped under ground.
Depending on the depth, and type of material most is stuck in the ground.
if it is absorbed into the ground it can not come back up because of  gravity
Yes, when the water is asorbed into the groun it becomes stuck there.
No, because as water is absorbed into the ground, water vapor is going into the atmosphere. 
The water drops are sinking through the surface and then are getting trapped in the black layer of the ground.
It moves through the soil and rocks in the ground, it can also be evaporated.
the water can be evaporated
Yes, it is because it does not stay in the ground, it passes on to nourish the ground and everything that grows on it, and it evaporates as well, beginning a cycle.
there can be some water that falls evaporates and goes back up in the sky
Even though I mentioned this before, water will eventually be absorbed or evaporated in some way.
The water finds its way out eventually through an underground river that eventually surfaces or another way. 
it is not trapped in the ground because it has to get back up into the clouds in order to keep the water cycle going 
it can go wherever it wants in the ground.
yes becouse its not going to be able to move once its absorbed underground.
because some drops that i watched never got out of the ground, depending on how deep they were.
becuse water can move
My answer is yes but it can also be no. Some water is trapped in the sediment layers but some is also being evaporated.

The water is never trapped in the ground its always moving around.
because of the rock layers underground
water can come out of the ground at low points
i dont know 
it will spread outward 
i kniw this because when you look at it it goes back up into they sky. we know by this movement it could be evaporating.
It is the water that is evaporating.
When its absorbed into the ground, it gets trapped there and doesnt come out because there is no heat to evaporate it.
its not trapped in the ground because the water turns into gas.
because other then human activity there is no other way of releasing the water
it evaporates. or forms an aquifer.
because if it goes below the surfae and under the rocks then theh suun an not reach it.
It can evaporate.
The water could not evaporate once it's in the ground.
water can be brought back to the surface and evaperated.
water can be brought back to the surface and evaperated.
It can stay trapped for a long time but it can be pumped out, or the water table could rise so much that the water comes out of the ground.
I would imagine that we would be able to get it back somehow
It can move to other places and it can be evaporated from the suns rays.
no because the sediment layers above it are very permeable and porous
People can remove the water.
Some of the water is drawn up from the ground through the roots of plants. 
water can be drawn from the ground by humans for our use
because it can evaporate
Can be used as an aquifer for groundwater
We can dig out the water that gets into the ground 
it evaporates out
 no because water is constantly moving 
because it can't seep past the rock, it stays put until someone comes by and retrieves it.
I don't know.
because of the air taking the water into the air
all the water goes in the ground and it traps so only the soil can soak up the water.
it doesn't get trapped in the ground. it's like groundwater.
it evaporates
water is absorbed into the ground and is in there only if a well is installed
The water goes through the Sand and Gravel. But when it get further down, it hits the Clay and Bedrock. It slowly goes through the Clay to get to the Bedrock, but then it's stuck at the Bedrock, just collecting water there.
the water will go to the 

lowest point and then over flow

Water can get through anything.
Once the water gets to a solid mineral in the ground, it will be stuck there for a while.
Some can evaporate or enter a stream.
the ground would soak up the water. or we could get to it by wells
the if its not trapped until someone diggs it up then no its not trapped mother nature can bring it back up.
The water can be brought up to the surface through a well.
When absorbed into the ground the water goes through layers of sediments, but cant be absorbed by bedrock
It stops on the very last sediment.
when it gets hot enough the water will rise and evaporate into the air.
its absorbs it 
It is collected in an aquifer underground.
ITS THE LONGEST
It can be taken out by a well
we can dig it back up
it can still be forced out
because
evaporation
it can't evaporate
idc
 water it falls and drops and absorb pool water drops
because water comes back through a water cycle 
It moves to underground streams and flows into lakes
yes
because in the morning the ground has a dew point and the water comes out of the ground.
It can't get out because there is something below and above it
The ground doesn't stay wet after it rains forever so it gets evaporated.
no, because the water is not trapped because you can find water if you dig real deep 
it can't go anywhere
Some is evaporated into the sky
Ground water can flow into streams, wells, lakes etc. 
The water eventually comes back up. It also is used for plant life through respiration.
Eventually the water has to come out somehow or all of it would all be trapped in the ground now. 
It can be retracted from the ground with use of different types of tools
it evaporates from the ground to repeat the cycle. 
In the diagram, the water collect above the clay and is trapped because it has nowhere left to go.
water goes back to lakes and streams through the ground.
it is evaporated back into the air.
Because in the graph it shows how the water is absorbed and it is not going back to the air or even disappearing in general.
It stays there andoesnt go anywhere
not in runs into  a well witch can come out
i can not 
because we can alway dig to reach the clean water underground.
it will stay above the clay, but it can be extracted by digging and other various methods.
Water is not trapped because it will eventually evaporate to continue the water cycle.
The water can't get past the bottom layer. 
When there is enough moisture in the ground some of it will come out of the top again
The water just sits in the bottom of the bedrock and piles up
The water droplets all go towards the ground, and once they've all elevated towards the ground, there's only a few water droplets left in the air, hense the water cycle.
not answered
it creates an aquifer under the ground 
It can always be removed or evaporated 
water is located at groundwater
it won't evaporate while it is underground, but it will stay atop of the clay layer
yes they all go into the ground, but aventually they all turn into water vapor. (it could take a long time though)
Water moves on after a while, it is not trapped there forever.
It absorbs into soil and flows into groundwater. Or it evaporates.
The water droplets stay in the ground, which is clearly shown by the diagram, in that all of the droplets are trapped.
It can leak into any river, ocean, sea, etc. It could get evaporated also. 
According to the graph, once the water is soaked into the ground, it keeps moving down.
it cant evaporate because it is trapped beneath layers of rock
not really because after the water drops to the ground it drys up
this water can move freely an can evaporate 
We can get the water from the ground
it can still surface and end up in a lake or river.
it soaks down deeper into the ground
The blue dots arent moving up. 
The ground can only absorb so much water. Once it takes all it can, the rain will stay on the surface where it lands and eventually evaporates.. The water absorbed goes to plants, which is also cycled back into the cycle.
It can still be dig up by humans.

the water is surrounded by other water?
One can see the green raindrops rising from the ground and into the sky.
The water can be absorbed into the ground, but it can also be released back into the atmosphere, as shown by the green dots by transpiration.  Transpiration occurs from plants and trees realeasing the water back into the atmosphere.  
The water can evaporate, be taken out, moves it location
it can evaporate
It looks like when the water absorbs into the ground it stays there.
In the diagram, water that has been absorbed by the ground is being evaporated, as indicated when a blue dot in the ground region on the diagram disappears, being replaced by a lifting green dot in the sky region.
Some water is leaving the ground
not answered
there are no green dots coming out of the ground

most of the water builds up beneath the ground
When it seeps into the ground and goes deeper into it, it has no other place it can go but down.

there can be evaporation
because it can be absorbed by the sun
Water evaporates.
it can still be evaporated
Water can sometimes leak out into a river or ocean
the blue dots begin to disappear in the ground
When the water gets further in the ground it cannot evaporate.
Because eventually they porosity is too low to let the water through
There is ways to drill into the soil. But it turns into capillary water. 
the water gets trapped in the porosity space of the particles
No the water is not trapped underground because the water needs to flow through the ground and the water needs to be evaporated, so it is not technically trapped.
becasue it will get absorbed througth the pores
Depending on the depth, and type of material most is stuck in the ground.
Because it could evaporate
Because I never saw them leave.
because the water cannot evaporate into the sky while its under the ground. 
yes by percittation and by the wtater sinking into the ground to priovide water for plants
no because we can pump it out of the ground and turn it into fresh water
no because you can pump it out.
it stays below ground and moves around
plants drink it and its expelled
It can be tapped into by wells
not answered
Its not trapped in the ground. Reason being is because when its hot enough, like when the sun comes out, the water evaporates from the ground and goes up into the sky. 
Evapotation takes place so its not trapped
water somehow could escape.
It then just stays there and moisturizes the ground.
its absorbed and disapears
If there is a large amount of water, it would probably eat the soil to the point where it collapses, making a mess. but eventually make a pond. or something.
In some parts it's absorbed because of the different layers but in other parts it is not becuase of the thick/thinness of layers

all water eventually comes back up with time because of evaporation 
In the model, it shows the blue dots hitting the ground and going to different layers of the earth.
when the water is absorbed, it is trapped in the ground because there is no sunlight to evaporate or have the water rise to have it be condensed again, and it will eventually find its way to an aquifer or underground water source.
The model wasn't working for me, so this answer is from my own knowledge, I think no because water can transpiration from plants and trees and go into the atmosphere.  
It can be brought up by us or by a natural effect.
It travels down until it hits the bedrock and turns into puddles once it is filtered
The water will be absorbed but eventually evaporate
It goes through the ground seeping through it.
they go into wells and other stuff
No, because it evaporates after a while.
Because it comes from the sky to the ground.
No because once it gets in the ground it absorbs it then it gets evaporated then goes back into the water cycle.

It goes through the different levels of sediments and then once it hits the clay, it stays there till evaporated or used by plants.
There is nothing that can uplift the water or make the water magically rise.
It just stays down there
When water is absorbed into the ground, it is trapped. This is because the water has no where else to run to.
it stops when it hits the clay
Yes and No! the water is trapped there until someone finds it and builds a well. But, if it isn't found then yes it is trapped.
The video is not working so I am not certain
because you can drill it 
because of evaporation 
the water pools up
it soaks in 
I LOOKED AT THE GRAPH
it can't get back out.
No it will move through out the ground
the water will come up into the plants, soil.
they don't come back out
it falls and it flows into underground aquifers 
the model above showes this
because it can evaporate

The water stays always flowing.
The water stays always flowing because the sediment is made up of different particles that never prevent the water from flowing. The air space between the particles allow the water to maintain its flow.

It does remain in the ground for a short period of time but due to evaporation water is evaporated by the suns energy and is released through vapor to the sky.
The water droplets can flow through the ground and then run through the ground to a water source.
Water goes through the soil because the soil absorbs it from flowing.
Water goes through the soil because the soil absorbs it from flowing and shown from the graph supports our evidence and claim. Also, the layers and sediments are not all solid so water can penetrate through it until a solid layer layer changes its path and stops it. 
The water droplets create pools of water where it is stopped by the black layer. This means that it is trapped.
It is trapped int he ground because the black layer won't let the water seep through that layer. The water moves from the right and sinks to the ground and also moves slowly.
Because water is still coming up through the sediment slowly and not in such high quantities as the water that is exposed to the air. This is seen through he few light blue water droplets that are evaporating over the sediment in the diagram.
When the water is absorbed into the ground it is not trapped because, the water can eventually evaporate.

Yes, the water is trapped because there is no sunlight reaching the water therefore the water would not be able to evaporate and leave the sediment. As shown on the model only the water at the top receiving sunlight is the one permitted to leave. Also the water will continue to be absorbed by the layers as it does not stop ascending. 
Water is trapped in the ground since it does not move when it reaches the bottom.

The water when absorbed by the ground, is not trapped in the ground because the water evaporates. When the water is precipitating it falls into the river. The water in the model is moving slowly but a lot at a period of time. Then the water gets absorbed by the ground, the water is not trapped because it is moving very slowly and the water can evaporate.

Once water is absorbed into the ground it is trapped. The water is trapped because it is being absorbed and draining to the bottom layer of ground where it is stopped. The water moved strictly down unto the ground.
After the water is absorbed into the ground it is stopped and held by a impermeable rock layer, creating an aquifer.
The water is not trapped in the ground, it evaporates back out but at a slower rate. 
Water is trapped trapped in the ground, because if you actually do the model and let the model run for while, you will see has the water continues to fall, the lowest level (black color), keeps the water from flowing through anymore levels of the ground. And as more water continues to fall, the water builds up creating a lake, pound, etc. 
Once the water enters the ground from the atmosphere, it is trapped in the ground. The black layer helps to keep the water from seeping any further down, the water in the ground helps with the underground aquifers too. 
Yes it is trapped in the ground because the black layer blocks the water from flowing through it. 
When it goes into the ground it is held there and creates an aquifer.
its not fully trapped untill we get to it
its not fully trapped untill we get to it for the fresh water.
No it isn't stuck. Water moves and serves as a lubricant for Earth's plates. 
Evaparation will start to take place after a while. The water in the ground will slowly start to dry, and go into the sky.
I a way it is trapped but with the technology we have today it can easily be removed if we need it.
The water is trapped in the ground because it is absorbed by the black layer and does not move, as shown by the module.
It is absorbed into the ground
I think this the right answer because as i watched the model i watched as water droplets fell, were then absorbed by the ground, and they stayed there.  
I think that when water is absorbed by the ground that it is not trapped in the ground. I think this because water is always moving it never stays in one spot.
Water is not trapped in the ground when in the ground because of one thing and that is the water cycle. That makes sure that the water is constantly moving through each step of the cycle. So the water will eventually evaporate from the ground. 
the water will go through all he top layers till it hits the last layer and it is trapped in the ground. 
Water is never trapped because it has to keep moving through the water cycle. 
The water can be retrieved from the ground because when there is enough water in the ground, ponds and lakes start to form so the water isn't trapped it is simply being held by the ground.
Water doesn't flow up.
Water doesn't flow up. If water cannot flow upward, then it has no way to leave the ground. On some layers it was hard to flow down into, more energy would be required to even try to flow upward.
Only for a certain amount of time the water is absorbed in the water.
Water is constantly moving, once in the ground water can travel down through layers or flow into water sources. It may be taken up by the roots on plants or by wells.  
No, because evaporation would allow it to come back up from the ground.
Yes, the water gets trapped in the ground, because if its not flowing where would it be going
The water looks trapped because it can not continue to flow below the black layer of land  is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.

Once the sun comes out, it can be evaporated back into the clouds. When it gets cloudy the clouds are filled with rain which is the rain originally from the ground and then that falls and gets reabsorbs in the ground. The water is able to move because of the amount of water in the ground.  The water collects and goes in between the cracks of each sediment  and create a pool of water under the rocks. In the model the rain is falling down from the sky from the clouds and fall on the sediments and go into the ground they then go to the lowest point of the ground to gather up into a body of water

because after a period of time the water will slowly seep out of the ground to form a pond
As the graph shows, the water is trapped in the ground. I do not think the water will come back up to the surface. 
As the graph shows, the water is trapped in the ground. I do not think the water will come back up to the surface. I think this because the graph shows the water being trapped and the water doesn't come back up. The one raindrop I had been watching has been stuck at the bottom and will not rise.

I think this because the graph shows the water being trapped and the water doesn't come back up. The one raindrop I had been watching has been stuck at the bottom and will not rise. I believe the water is being stuck in the ground because of all the other water pilled on top of it. If it were to rise, the other water on top would have to rise first.

The water can continually gather until it reaches ground level, where it can easily be collected. Or, humans have created wells in order to retrieve underground water.
Once the water enters the ground, it does not stay still in one place, so it isn't trapped. However, it does not return to the air unless it is evaporated right away, so it does stay underground but it is not necessarily trapped.
Once the water enters the ground, it does not stay still in one place, so it isn't trapped. However, it does not return to the air unless it is evaporated right away, so it does stay underground but it is not necessarily trapped. For example, in the model, the water enters the top layers and travels down into the other layers but stops before the black layer, and moves laterally in the water.
The cartoon shows that the water is absorbed by the ground, and then goes to the ground water supply, where all the water gathers. Water does not go back up through the ground, it stays underground above the clay layer. 
yes the water after hitting the black stays in one place and doesn't go deeper. it rains and then it hits the surface layers and travels down through the middle layers of the earth.

While the water does get stopped before the final black layer, the water is not trapped within the ground. You can see the water droplets move through the dark brown, light brown, and pink layers and none of the droplets gets trapped in the sub layers. It might be trapped from going back into the atmosphere but not within underground layers. 
no it can be accesed by man
no, it can be accessed by man. by drilling into the earth
based on the animation, eventually, the water will gather enough to match or pass the ground level.
based on the animation, eventually, the water will gather enough to match or pass the ground level. The model showed that the water would absorb into the ground and would continue to build up, constantly rising in level.
